# 🔢 Array Problems in Java  

This repository contains solutions to common **array problems** in Java.  
Each problem is implemented from scratch with:  
- 📘 Explanation of the **idea**  
- ⏱️ **Time & Space Complexity**

## 📂 Problems Covered  

### 🔹 1. Largest Element in an Array  
- **Idea:** Traverse the array and keep track of the maximum element encountered.  
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)  
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)  
- **Best Use:** Finding the maximum value in an unsorted array.  
- **Example:**  
  Input:  arr = [10, 4, 3, 50, 23, 90]  
  Output: Largest element = 90
### 🔹 2. Second Largest Element in an Array  
- **Idea:** Traverse the array and keep track of the second maximum element encountered.  
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)  
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)  
- **Best Use:** Finding the second maximum value in an unsorted array.  
- **Example:**  
  Input:  arr = [10, 4, 3, 50, 23, 90]  
  Output: Largest element = 50

### 🔹 3. Check if Array is Sorted (Non-decreasing Order)
**Idea:** Traverse the array and check if each element is greater than or equal to the previous one.
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
- **Best Use:** Validating if an array is sorted for further algorithms like binary search.
- **Example:**  
Input:  arr = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]  
Output: true
Input:  arr = [90, 80, 100, 70, 40, 30]  
Output: false
