### 1️⃣ Binary Search on 1D Array

- **Idea:**  
  Use the binary search algorithm to efficiently find the index of a target element in a sorted array. Repeatedly divide the search interval in half, comparing the middle element to the target and narrowing the search range accordingly.
- **Time Complexity:** O(log n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
- **Best Use:** Quickly search for an element in a sorted array, commonly used in search problems and interview questions.
- **Example:**  
  Input: `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`, `target = 7`  
  Output: `Element found at index: 6`
